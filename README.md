# Rebase
* Don’t rebase a branch that multiple people have access to! Only rebase branches in your fork. As I’ve already mentioned, rebasing is a destructive operation. If you’re doing it in your repository, which only you can access, then there’s no issue. If you rebase a branch that other people have access to, you’re going to run into trouble. So only rebase your own branches, and only push those rebased branches to your own fork.
